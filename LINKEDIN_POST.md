🏆 **Day 7 of 30: Week 1 Complete – 6 Projects, 7 Days, Infinite Momentum**

One week ago, I started a challenge to build a technical portfolio from scratch. Today, I’m looking back at 168 hours of intense learning, building, and sharing.

To celebrate, I built a **Week 1 Recap Dashboard** using **Streamlit** to showcase everything I've accomplished so far.

🚀 **The Week 1 Stats:**
✅ **Day 1**: Built a modern Portfolio Website (The Hub).
✅ **Day 2**: Automated 5 core tasks with Python (Efficiency).
✅ **Day 3**: Mastered advanced SQL hierarchies & ranking (Data Depth).
✅ **Day 4**: Shipped a production-ready REST API (Backend).
✅ **Day 5**: Created a modular Data Cleaning Pipeline (Engineering).
✅ **Day 6**: Developed an Interactive Sales Dashboard (Insights).

**The Reflection:**
The transition from my previous internship to completing graduate studies at TTU has been a journey of constant adaptation. This week proved that I don't just know the theory—I can execute, document, and deploy.

**What’s Next?** 
Week 2 is all about **Technical Depth**. We’re going deeper into real-time pipelines, web scraping, and system design.

**Recruiters:** Week 1 shows my range. Week 2 will show my depth. Let’s connect!

## Posting Tips

1. **The Visual**: This is the best day to share a **Carousel**. Include one slide for each project (Day 1-6) and a final slide for your Recap dashboard.
2. **The Hook**: Focus on the volume of work. "6 projects in 7 days" is a high-energy hook.
3. **Engagement**: Tag people who have commented on your posts this week to thank them for the support.
